                “between” 23 to 34, who want to help with youth development and creating job opportunities amongst the
                disadvantaged youth in South Africa. The organisation addresses social issues such as unemployment,
                gender based violence and women empowerment in emphasising empowerment and sustainability within the
                community. We are the most reliable and hardworking organisation. Our mission is to help close the
                poverty gap within the community, create awareness and lend a helping hand.
                We are conscious with facilitating with youth development and women empowerment in our disadvantaged
                communities and are committed to growing and adapting our organisation to meet the emerging needs. YV
                Foundation will provide comprehensive access to job opportunities and social services to the youth in
                our community.
